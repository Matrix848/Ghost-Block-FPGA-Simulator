# ghost-block-fpga-simulator

[![CI](https://github.com//ghost-block-fpga-simulator/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Matrix848/ghost-block-fpga-simulator/actions)

A simulator for the ghost block FPGA ideated by Aha that I built. Configurations for this simulator will be generated by the compiler(didn't start to program it yet) or can be created by the built-in shell of the simulator.
